## Image Classification

Welcome to the first Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course!

This image classification problem requires to classify images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people. In the specific, the solution must discriminate between images depending on the following cases: 1) All the people in the image are wearing a mask, 2) No person in the image is wearing a mask, 3) Someone in the image is not wearing a mask. In the following an example of an image from the training belonging to the class 3:

Thus, the classification is performed on 3 different classes. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.
